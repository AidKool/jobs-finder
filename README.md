## General Information

The purpose of this app is so user clients can: 

- Fill out a form with criteria of the type of job they are looking for.
- Once the form has been submitted the user will be provided with all available jobs matching their search criteria.
- Job cards will be displayed showing the company name, location, salary and a brief description.
- The user can then click on the job title and a modal will pop up showing the full details of the job.
- If a user likes a job they can save it via local storage and it will be rendered on the favourites page.
- The app also has a interactive map that provides wellbeing statistics for some cities in the UK.
